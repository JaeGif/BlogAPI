Messages Options need to be developed separately and integrated into the application.
Messages will require a working knowledge of WebSockets for real-time communication

Notifications requires the friend system to be fleshed out first as following will be the 
most important available notification, followed by likes/comments

Search function will be the last to be implemented as it will search through 
all available data, there's no point in implementing it before the other
features are fully implemented.
