## What I learned

This project is my first attempt at making a RESTful API serve the data in json format. In previous projects, I've used an Express backend to serve views populated with the data requested.

This is my first fullstack app using React and Express together as well as my first attempt to use a CSS framework (Tailwind). This app represents a typical data serving website and is meant to showcase my ability as a Full-Stack Dev.

Thanks for viewing, I hope you enjoyed.
